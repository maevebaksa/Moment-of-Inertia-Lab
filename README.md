This CSV folder contains 3 different types of files RunX (which contains the data for RunX and all previous runs, RunXonly which is a seperated run file and finally RunXsmoothed which is the best data to used for analysis as the data was pruned for extanious data. This should allow anybody to calculate the moment of inertia. There are also preanalyzed images and frames taken from the videos.
