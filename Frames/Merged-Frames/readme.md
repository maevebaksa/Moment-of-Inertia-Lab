# Important Notes

Some of these are shot at 240FPS while others are at 120FPS.

120FPS:
- Runs 1 & 2
- Runs 4 - 8

240 FPS:
- Run3

The general file format name is XXX.PNG.
The first digit is the run, second (or middle two) is/are the drop number, third is the frame number.

Additionally note that for the Run3 in 240FPS, after a while it was difficult to pinpoint the changes between one frame
as it was so close together. Any file with a drawn 2 in the top left corner indicates that it is occuring over 2 frames
rather than just one frame (aka. 120FPS instead of 240FPS).
